During the transformation process, blocks can move one unit in any direction (forward, backward, left, right, up, down). If the target position is empty, the block can move there directly; if the target position already has a block, they swap places. Blocks cannot float in the air. If a block is moved away from a position, any block above it will fall down until reaching a supporting surface. The xyz axes are shown in the diagram, and each block's position can be precisely identified using coordinates (x1,y1,z1).
