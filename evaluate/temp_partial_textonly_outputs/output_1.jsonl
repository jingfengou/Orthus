The reasoning process and the answer are enclosed within <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think>reasoning process</think>, <answer>answer</answer>.\n<think>The initial state of the cube stack is shown in the top row of images, and the final state is shown in the bottom row. The transformation process involves moving blocks one unit in any direction (forward, backward, left, right, up, down). If the target position is empty, the block can move there directly; if the target position already has a block, they swap places. Blocks cannot float in the air. If a block is moved away from a position, any block above it will fall down until reaching a supporting surface. The xyz axes are shown in the diagram, and each block's position can be precisely identified using coordinates (x1,y1,z1).\n\nTo transform the cube stack from the initial state to the final state, we need to move the blocks in a specific order. We can start by moving the block in the top left corner to the top right corner. This can be done by moving the block one unit in the x-direction. Next, we need to move the block in the top right corner to the bottom right corner. This can be done by moving the block one unit in the y-direction. Finally, we need to move the block in the bottom right corner to the bottom left corner. This can be done by moving the block one unit in the z-direction.\n\nThe transformation sequence that can change the cube stack from the initial state to the final state is <answer>A) (2, 0, 0) x- -- (0, 0, 0) y+ -- (2, 0, 0) y+</answer>.\n\nThe reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1. Move the block in the top left corner to the top right corner. This can be done by moving the block one unit in the x-direction.\n2. Move the block in the top right corner to the bottom right corner. This can be done by moving the block one unit in the y-direction.\n3. Move the block in the bottom right corner to the bottom left corner. This can be done by moving the block one unit in the z-direction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <answer>A) (2, 0, 0) x- -- (0, 0, 0) y+ -- (2, 0", "generated_images": []}

Since the green gear is revolving counterclockwise, the other end of the green shaft will rotate clockwise. This is because the rotation of the gear is transmitted through the meshing teeth, which are in contact with each other. The direction of rotation is determined by the direction of the teeth, which are in contact with each other. In this case, the teeth on the green gear are in contact with the teeth on the blue gear, and the rotation of the green gear is transmitted to the other end of the green shaft through these teeth.
