The top left and bottom right corners of the grid are fixed, so there are two corners that are known.\n2. The top right and bottom left corners are also fixed, so there are two more corners that are known.\n3. The remaining four corners are not fixed, so there are four unknown corners.\n4. To satisfy the constraints, the four unknown corners must be placed on the grid in a way that the edges of the cubes do not overlap.\n5. The number of cubes needed to satisfy the constraints is equal to the number of unknown corners.\n6. Therefore, the number of cubes needed is 4, which is equal to the number of unknown corners.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 17.", "generated_images": []}

The grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the total number of cubes in the grid is 8 x 8 = 64. However, the grid has 32 cubes, which means that 32 cubes are missing. To satisfy the constraints, we need to add 32 cubes to the grid. The maximum number of cubes that can be added to the grid is 32, which is the number of cubes that are missing.
