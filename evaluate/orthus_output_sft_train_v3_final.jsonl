Arrows can move in four directions (forward, backward, left, right), where 'forward' always refers to the current direction the arrow is pointing. After each movement, the arrow's direction is updated to the direction of movement. If the target position is empty, the arrow can move there directly; otherwise, it needs to swap with the arrow at the target position, and both arrows' movements should satisfy the aforementioned requirements. After the transformations '((0, 0) Left, 2 units)--((1, 0) Right, 1 unit)', which state from the options can be reached?

During the transformation process, blocks can move one unit in any direction (forward, backward, left, right, up, down). If the target position is empty, the block can move there directly; if the target position already has a block, they swap places. Blocks cannot float in the air. If a block is moved away from a position, any block above it will fall down until reaching a supporting surface. The xyz axes are shown in the diagram, and each block's position can be precisely identified using coordinates (x1,y1,z1). Which of the following transformation sequences can change the cube stack from the initial state to the final state shown in the diagram?

During the transformation process, blocks can move one unit in any direction (forward, backward, left, right, up, down). If the target position is empty, the block can move there directly; if the target position already has a block, they swap places. Blocks cannot float in the air. If a block is moved away from a position, any block above it will fall down until reaching a supporting surface. The xyz axes are shown in the diagram, and each block's position can be precisely identified using coordinates (x1,y1,z1).

If a block is moved away from a position, any block above it will fall down until reaching a supporting surface.
