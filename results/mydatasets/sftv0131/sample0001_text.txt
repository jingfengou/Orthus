<think>First, rotate this cube stack along the X axis by 270 degrees. The resulting shape is as follows: . Then, rotate it along the Z axis by 270 degrees. Now let's visualize the current state: . Comparing the final image with the options provides the reasoning: A: This option uses incorrect rotation angles. B: this is the result after performing all rotation steps correctly. C: This option rotates along wrong axes, D: This option performs the rotations in wrong order. So the final Answer is B</think>. <Answer>B</Answer>
